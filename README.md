My experiments with svg.




SVG arc demo
-----------------
2016-09-03

http://codepen.io/lingtalfi/pen/yaLWJG


I created this demo to help me understand how svg arc works (and now I understand).

So, hopefully it might help you as well.

Note: The demo depends from the 60 lines library [simpledrag.js](https://github.com/lingtalfi/simpledrag).

Note2: the source code is in this repository too.

Note3: tested (successfully) with firefox 48, chrome 53.
