My experiments with svg.




SVG arc demo
-----------------

I created this demo to help me understand how svg arc works (and now I understand).

So, hopefully it might help you as well.

Note: The demo depends from the 60 lines library [simpledrag.js](https://github.com/lingtalfi/simpledrag).

Note2: the source code is in this repository too.

Note3: tested (successfully) with firefox 48, chrome 53.

Using svg to draw 12 lines for a css grid
----------------------

If you are creating a css grid system, having background lines showing where the columns are might be useful.
Svg can draw equally spaced vertical lines that resize with the window.
